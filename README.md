# Web_app_YouTube_Comments_Sentiment_Analysis
# This project is a sentiment analysis project for YouTube video comments, consisting of React front-end and 
# Flask server. The front-end allows users to input a YouTube video link and submit it for sentiment analysis. The 
# back-end receives the video link, downloads the comments of the video, preprocesses the comments, and uses a 
# pre-trained Naive Bayes classifier to predict the sentiment of each comment. The server then returns the most 
# common sentiment among the comments as the overall sentiment of the video, which is displayed to the user on 
# the front-end.
