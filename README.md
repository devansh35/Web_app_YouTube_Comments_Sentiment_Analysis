# Web_app_YouTube_Comments_Sentiment_Analysis
This project is a sentiment analysis project for YouTube video comments, consisting of React front-end and 
Flask server. The front-end allows users to input a YouTube video link and submit it for sentiment analysis. The 
back-end receives the video link, downloads the comments of the video, preprocesses the comments, and uses a 
pre-trained Naive Bayes classifier to predict the sentiment of each comment. The server then returns the most 
common sentiment among the comments as the overall sentiment of the video, which is displayed to the user on 
the front-end.
